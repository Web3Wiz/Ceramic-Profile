# Ceramic-Profile

Built a sovereign user profile using Ceramic Self.ID.

Next.js application which uses Self.ID and allow users to login to the website using their wallet of choice, which will be linked to their 3ID. Then, we will allow the user to create their decentralized profile, and be able to retrieve it from the Ceramic Network.
